h2(#loading). Using the library

If you want to use the library, you have to make Ruby load it by issuing:

  require 'dbus'

That's all!  Now we can move on to really using it...

h2(#connecting). Connecting to a bus

On a typical system, two buses are running, the system bus and the session
bus.  The system bus can be accessed by:

  bus = DBus::SystemBus.instance

Probably you already have guessed how to access the session bus. This
can be done by:

  bus = DBus::SessionBus.instance

h2(#method-call). Performing method calls

Let me continue this example using the session bus.  Let's say that I want
to access an object of some client on the session bus.  This particular
D-Bus client provides a service called @org.gnome.Rhythmbox@.  Let me
access this service:

  rb_service = bus.service("org.gnome.Rhythmbox")

In this example I access the @org.gnome.Rhythmbox@ service, which is
provided by the application
"Rhythmbox":http://www.gnome.org/projects/rhythmbox/.
OK, I have a service handle now, and I know that it exports the object
"/org/gnome/Rhythmbox/Player".  I will trivially access this remote object
using:

  rb_player = rb_service.object("/org/gnome/Rhythmbox/Player")

h3(#method-call--introspection). Introspection

Well, that was easy.  Let's say that I know that this particular object is
introspectable.  In real life most of them are.  The @rb_object@ object we
have here is just a handle of a remote object, in general they are called
_proxy objects_, because they are the local handle of a remote object.  It
would be nice to be able to make it have methods, and that its methods send
a D-Bus call to remotely execute the actual method in another process. 
Well, instating these methods for a _introspectable_ object is trivial:

  rb_player.introspect

And there you go.  Note that not all services or objects can be
introspected, therefore you have to do this manually!  Let me remind you
that objects in D-Bus have interfaces and interfaces have methods.  Let's
now access these methods:

  rb_player_iface = rb_player["org.gnome.Rhythmbox.Player"]
  puts rb_player_iface.getPlayingUri

As you can see, when you want to call a method on an instance object, you have
to get the correct interface. It is a bit tedious, so we have the following
shortcut that does the same thing as before:

  rb_player.default_iface = "org.gnome.Rhythmbox.Player"
  puts rb_player.getPlayingUri

The @default_iface=@ call specifies the default interface that should be
used when non existing methods are called directly on a proxy object, and
not on one of its interfaces.

Note that the bus itself has a corresponding introspectable object. You can
access it with @bus.proxy@ method. For example, you can retrieve an array of
exported service names of a bus like this:

  bus.proxy.ListNames[0]

h2(#method-call-async). Calling a method asynchronously

D-Bus is _asynchronous_.  This means that you do not have to wait for a
reply when you send a message.  When you call a remote method that takes a
lot of time to process remotely, you don't want your application to hang,
right?  Well the asychronousness exists for this reason.  What if you dont'
want to wait for the return value of a method, but still you want to take
some action when you receive it?

There is a classical method to program this event-driven mechanism.  You do
some computation, perform some method call, and at the same time you setup
a callback that will be triggered once you receive a reply.  Then you run a
main loop that is responsible to call the callbacks properly.  Here is how
you do it:

  rb_player.getPlayingUri do |resp|
  	puts "The playing URI is #{resp}"
  end
  puts "See, I'm not waiting!"
  loop = DBus::Main.new
  loop.run

This code will print the following:

  See, I'm not waiting!
  The playing URI is file:///music/papapingoin.mp3

h2(#signal-wait). Waiting for a signal

Signals are calls from the remote object to your program.  As a client, you
set yourself up to receive a signal and handle it with a callback.  Then running
the main loop triggers the callback.  You can register a callback handler
as allows:

  rb_player.on_signal("elapsedChanged") do |u|
  	puts u
  end

h2(#introspection). More about introspection

There are various ways to inspect a remote service.  You can simply call
@Introspect()@ and read the XML output.  However, in this tutorial I assume
that you want to do it using the Ruby D-Bus API.

Notice that you can introspect a service, and not only objects:

  rb_service = bus.service("org.gnome.Rhythmbox")
  rb_service.introspect
  p rb_service.root

This dumps a tree-like structure that represents multiple object paths.  In
this particular case the output is:

  </: {org => {gnome => {Rhythmbox => {Player => ..fdbe625de {},Shell => ..fdbe6852e {},PlaylistManager => ..fdbe4e340 {}}></code></pre>

Read this left to right:  the root node is "/", it has one child node "org",
"org" has one child node "gnome", and "gnome" has one child node "Rhythmbox". 
Rhythmbox has Tree child nodes "Player", "Shell" and "PlaylistManager". 
These three last child nodes have a weird digit that means it has an object
instance.  Such object instances are already introspected.

If the prose wasn't clear, maybe the following ASCII art will help you:

  /
  	org
  		gnome
  			Rhythmbox
  				Shell (with object)
  				Player (with object)
  				PlaylistManager (with object)

h3(#introspection--tree). Walking the object tree

You can have an object on any node, i.e. it is not limited to leaves.
You can access a specific node like this:

  rb_player = rb_service.root["org"]["gnome"]["Rhythmbox"]["Player"]
  rb_player = rb_service.object("/org/gnome/Rhythmbox/Player")

The difference between the two is that for the first one, @rb_service@
needs to have been introspected.  Also the obtained @rb_player@ is already
introspected whereas the second @rb_player@ isn't yet.
