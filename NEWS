   reported by Adde Nilsson).
 * Recognize signature "h" (UNIX_FD) used eg. by Upstart (Issue#23,
   by Bernd Ahlers).
 * Find the session bus also via launchd, on OS X (Issue#20, reported
   by Paul Sturgess).

A brown-paper-bag release.

Bug fixes:

   DBus::Main#run when a service becomes idle (by Ravil Bayramgalin)

== Ruby D-Bus 0.7.1 - 2012-04-04

Bug fixes:
 * Fixed calling asynchronous methods on the default interface (Issue#13,
   by Eugene Korbut). 
 * Fixed Main#quit to really quit the loop (by Josef Reidinger)
 * Unbundled files from Active Support (by Bohuslav Kabrda)

== Ruby D-Bus 0.7.0 - 2011-07-26

Features:
 * Added ASystemBus and ASessionBus, non-singletons useful in tests
   and threads.

Bug fixes:
 * Fixed handling of multibyte strings (Issue#8, by Takayuki YAMAGUCHI).
 * Allow reopening of a dbus_interface declaration (Issue#9, by T. YAMAGUCHI).
 * Fixed ruby-1.9.2 compatibility again (Issue#12).
 * Fixed authentication on BSD (Issue#11, by Jonathan Walker)
 * Fixed exiting a nested event loop for synchronous calls
   (reported by Timo Warns).
 * Fixed introspection calls leaking reply handlers.
 * "rake test" now works, doing what was called "rake env:test"

== Ruby D-Bus 0.6.0 - 2010-12-11

Features:
 * Clients can access properties conveniently (Ticket#28).

Bug fixes:
 * Service won't crash whan handling an unknown method or interface (Ticket#31).
 * Don't send an invalid error name when it originates from a NameError.

== Ruby D-Bus 0.5.0 - 2010-11-07

Features:
 * Better binding of Ruby Exceptions to D-Bus Errors.
 * Converted the package to a Gem (Issue#6).
 * Converted the tutorial from Webgen to Markdown.

Bug fixes:
 * Don't pass file descriptors to subprocesses.
 * Fixed InterfaceElement::validate_name (Ticket#38, by Herwin Weststrate).
 * Fixed a typo in InvalidDestinationName description (Ticket#40).

== Ruby D-Bus 0.4.0 - 2010-08-20

Features:
 * TCP transport (by pangdudu)
 * Enabled test code coverage report (rcov)

Bug fixes:
 * Classes should not share all interfaces (Ticket#36/Issue#5)
 * Ruby 1.9 compatibility (Ticket#37, by Myra Nelson)

== Ruby D-Bus 0.3.1 - 2010-07-22

Bug fixes:
 * Many on_signal could cause DBus.Error.LimitsExceeded bnc#617350).
   Don't add a match rule that already exists, enable removing match
   rules. Now only one handler for a rule is called (but it is possible
   for one signal to match more rules). This reverts the half-fix done
   to fix Issue#3

 * Handle more ways which tell us that a bus connection has died.

 * Get the session bus address even if unset in ENV (Issue#4).

   UndefinedInterface, InvalidMethodName, NoMethodError, no RuntimeException

 These are by Klaus Kaempf:
 * Make the signal dispatcher call all handlers (Issue#3).
 * Run on Ruby < 1.8.7 (Issue#2).
 * Avoid needless DBus::IncompleteBufferException (Ticket#33).
 * Don't ignore DBus Errors in request_service, raise them (Ticket#32).

   (Ticket#31).
